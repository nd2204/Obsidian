Funds displayed in a seller’s payment account balance are eligible for deposit (the “Available Funds”) into a seller’s bank account or other applicable account (i.e., a Payoneer Payment Account), subject to any applicable reserve(s) and corresponding reserve limit, hold, or deposit delay, as described in Section B. Reserves; Holds and Delays below, and as otherwise determined by the seller’s bank.

For deposits below designated thresholds in certain markets, a deposit fee will apply. See Section 9 below for details on deposit fees. A deposit minimum also applies to deposits in certain markets. Funds will only be available for deposit if they exceed the applicable deposit minimum.

B. Reserves; Holds and Delays

To protect the security and integrity of our marketplace, the users of the Etsy services, and Etsy, Etsy may take account-level or transaction-level actions based on risk-based criteria, like the criteria listed below. Some of our decisions about reserves, holds and delays may be based on criteria that demonstrate a seller’s ability to fulfill orders in a manner consistent with Etsy’s policies. These criteria are essential to our management of risk and the protection of Etsy and our users. Etsy reserves the right to use a combination of reserves, deposit delays, and holds on your account.

Dự trữ.

Một dữ trữ là khoản tiền đang chờ giải quyết như đã được chỉ ra trong tài khoản thanh toán. Một dự trữ sẽ được đặt ở trong tài khoản của bạn nếu chúng tôi tin rằng có thể có một mức độ rủi ro tài chính cấp cao liên quan đến bạn, tài khoản của bạn, mô hình kinh doanh hay giao dịch của bạn.

Khi một dự trữ được áp dụng trên tài khoản thanh toán của bạn, điều đó có nghĩa là một phần trăm số tiền ở trong số dư tài khoản thanh toán của bạn bị treo
When a Reserve is applied on your payment account, it means that a percentage of the funds in your payment account balance is held on an ongoing basis, and will not be made available for disbursement as Available Funds for a specified period of time. The Reserve percentage applies to amounts from your sales that would otherwise be available for disbursement. The percentage Reserve applied to your account is determined by your risk level and is used to create a threshold amount (explained in detail below) that applies to your payment account balance while you are in Reserve. You’ll be notified by email if a Reserve is applied to your Payment Account. The email you receive notifying you that you are in Reserve will include details of the Reserve, including the period of Reserve and the percentage applied to your Payment Account.

Threshold Reserve Amount applicable to your Account
The threshold reserve amount is the amount of funds you must have in your Payment Account while you’re in Reserve before you’ll have money available to disburse to your bank account (the “Threshold Reserve Amount”). The Threshold Reserve Amount will maintain the percentage Reserve that has been applied to your account. As a result, it may increase and decrease as appropriate to reflect new activity in your payment account, like sales you’ve received, refunds and chargebacks, charges to your payment account where applicable, as well as and Reserve amounts released to you. The Threshold Reserve will also determine the amount of funds available to be disbursed to your bank account as Available Funds and the amount of funds that are pending, because they are still in Reserve. Funds in excess of the Threshold Reserve Amount are available to you for disbursement as described in Section 7A above. Funds below the Threshold Reserve Amount are your Reserved funds and are not available for disbursement until the end of the applicable Reserve period. If your Reserve funds are used to cover any charges and your Reserve funds fall below the Threshold Reserve Amount, funds from subsequent sales will be applied to your Reserve funds to help you meet and maintain your Threshold Reserve Amount. You can view your Threshold Reserve Amount, as well as any Reserved funds and funds available to you for disbursement (Available Funds), in your Payment Account.
Reserve funds will be used to address potential financial risk such as refunds, chargebacks, claims, or seller fees and charges, where your Available Funds do not sufficiently cover such charges. Reserve funds that are not used to address refunds, chargebacks, claims or seller fees, where applicable, will be released to you in full at the end of the corresponding Reserve period on a rolling basis. However, Reserve funds will not be released if, during the Reserve period relating to a particular sale, a buyer raises a case against you, or files a chargeback, and you do not have sufficient funds in your Available Funds to cover a potential refund. Etsy relies on different risk factors (and whether and how these factors have changed over time) to determine whether and how much of a Reserve should be applied to your payment account, including:

How long you’ve been in business on Etsy (including how long since you’ve made your first sale)
Details of your sales (including volume and average sales earnings)
The extent of any backlog of orders from your shop
Availability of shipping tracking information
Types of goods you sell (whether they’re ready to ship or made to order)
Ratio of cases (disputes) opened by buyers in respect of your sales
Suspensions or warnings already received
Estimated delivery times; and
Shipping status of active orders
Types of Account Reserves:

A fixed reserve is a fixed percentage of your payment account balance at the time a Reserve is placed on your account, which will be held for a specified period of time. After that, the same percentage of each of your subsequent sales will be held in Reserve, each for a specified period of time. Reserve funds will be held for such period and where applicable, will be used to address chargebacks, refunds, and pay seller fees. Reserve funds will be released on a rolling basis after the corresponding Reserve period expires, unless a case is raised against you by a buyer. Any funds above the Threshold Amount of your Reserve will be available to be disbursed as described in Section 7A.

For example, your Reserve could be set at 30% and held for a 45-day rolling period – meaning 30% of the funds in your payments account balance on day 1 are Reserved and then released on day 46. If you make a sale on day 2, 30% of the funds you receive from that sale on day 2 is reserved until day 47, etc. If you make a sale on day 4, 30% of the funds you receive from that sale are reserved until day 49. If any chargebacks are filed against you, or refunds to buyers are required, or seller fees are charged, and your Available Funds are insufficient to cover such costs Reserve funds will be used to address those charges. If Reserve funds are used for such purpose(s), such funds will be released to you for disbursement less such amounts.
A variable reserve is a percentage, determined as appropriate by Etsy’s risk team, of a seller’s payment account balance (i) delayed prior to being included as part of a seller’s Available Funds for a period of up to 180 days or (ii) deducted from a seller's payment account as a reserve for a period of up to 90 days. A variable reserve may be placed on a seller’s payment account balance in addition to any applicable Fixed Reserve in Etsy’s sole discretion. Account Reserves are placed on an account on a case by case basis, in reference to the factors listed above and other risk-based criteria, and are reviewed from time to time. Etsy may deem a seller eligible for reduction in the percentage or removal of a Reserve due to a change in our risk-assessment of a seller based on the factors listed above, or as a result of a seller’s positive performance, such as a reduction in cases or an improvement in the seller’s fulfillment of orders. Etsy may increase the Reserve percentage held and/or the period for which the Reserve applies based on our re-review of a seller account against the factors listed above, and other risk-based criteria. If we change the terms of a Reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms.

Here are some steps you can take to reduce the likelihood of having a Reserve applied to your account.

Holds and Delays. In some cases, deposits to a seller's bank accounts could be temporarily delayed by an issue at Etsy, Etsy’s third-party service providers, or a seller’s bank. We’ll do our best to communicate with any affected seller as soon as we can.

Separately, if we believe that a seller's actions may result in buyer disputes, chargebacks, increased risk of fraud, counterfeiting, or other claims, then we may, in addition to any applicable Reserve and in our sole discretion, put a hold or deposit delay on the seller’s payment account balance.

A hold may be put on funds associated with a particular transaction if there is a dispute or investigation related to the order, for the shorter of: (a) 180 days after the estimated delivery date, or (b) completion of any investigation regarding the seller’s actions.
Deposit delays are defined as the number of days between a sale and the day the net amount from the sale becomes available for deposit, provided the payment has been completed. A deposit delay may be between 0 and 180 days. A deposit delay is applied across all transactions for a seller and the number of days is reflected in each seller’s payment account.
If Etsy places a hold or deposit delay on a seller’s account, we’ll do our best to communicate with the affected seller as appropriate as soon as we can.

We always work hard to avoid and minimize any delays. However, please note that Etsy is not obligated to refund any fees or reimburse any expenses due to holds or delayed deposits.

C. Country and Currency Options. In the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Türkiye, United Kingdom and Vietnam, Available Funds can only be deposited into bank accounts, in the domestic currency of the account, which includes the following currencies: US Dollars (USD), Australian Dollars (AUD), Canadian Dollars (CAD), Swiss Francs (CHF), Danish Krone (DKK), Euros (EUR), British Pounds (GBP), Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), Israeli Shekel (ILS), Moroccan Dirham (MAD), Mexican Peso (MXN), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), New Zealand Dollars (NZD), Norwegian Krone (NOK), Philippine Peso (PHP), Swedish Krona (SEK), Singapore Dollars (SGD), Turkish Lira (TRY), South African Rand (ZAR) and Vietnamese Dong (VND). In Argentina, Chile, China, India, Japan, Peru, Thailand and Ukraine, funds will be deposited to your Payoneer Payment Account in United States Dollar (USD) and through Payoneer’s payment services you can subsequently withdraw to your local bank account in your local currency.

D. Scheduled Deposits. Etsy will instruct our payments partners to initiate a deposit of a seller’s Available Funds into the seller’s bank account on a daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis. Sellers can select the frequency of disbursements from their payment account in their account settings. When a seller selects daily disbursements, disbursements will be made on each day that the seller's payment account has a balance equal to or greater than the minimum daily disbursement thresholds listed below. When a seller selects weekly, biweekly, or monthly disbursements, disbursements will be made on every applicable Monday. In this policy we'll refer to the date of disbursement as the "Payment Date." Deposits into a seller’s bank account will generally be credited within three (3) to five (5) business days from the date Etsy initiates the deposit request. The actual timing of the deposit may depend on how quickly a seller’s bank processes the request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disbursements for sellers using a Payoneer Payment Account will be made weekly on Mondays if a seller has a positive disbursement balance.

The Payment Date will fall on the next business day (Monday through Friday, excluding bank holidays) if the scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-business day. If a seller elects to change the frequency of disbursements, the following deposit will be initiated on the next business day if the seller selects daily disbursements, or on the next applicable Monday if the seller selects weekly, biweekly, or monthly disbursements. When a seller either initially provides or later changes their bank account information, the seller must wait at least five (5) calendar days to request a deposit into a bank account as a security precaution. The next scheduled deposit after a change to bank account information will occur on the next applicable Payment Date after a period of five (5) calendar days from the date of the requested change.

E. Escheatment. If Etsy cannot settle funds into a seller’s bank account, or the seller is refused service by Etsy under Etsy’s Terms of Use, the funds will remain with Etsy and the balance remains available in the seller’s payment account. It is the seller’s sole responsibility to update their bank account information to receive the funds, if applicable. If a seller fails to update the information to claim the funds within a certain period of time, or Etsy cannot release funds to the seller for compliance reasons, Etsy will escheat the funds to the relevant government authority as required in order to comply with applicable escheatment laws.

8. Recoupment
A. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to seek reimbursement from a seller in any of the following circumstances: (a) we provide a refund to a buyer because a seller did not promptly deliver the goods or we otherwise determine, consistent with Section 5 (Seller Rights and Responsibilities], that a refund is warranted in a particular circumstance, (b) we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions related to a seller, (c) we receive a chargeback from a buyer's credit card issuer or reversal of payment for the amount of a buyer's purchase from a seller, or (d) a seller does not act in accordance with Etsy’s policies.

B. We may obtain reimbursement of any amounts owed by a seller to Etsy by deducting from future payments owed to the seller, reversing any credits to the seller’s payment account balance, charging the seller's card on file, charging the seller’s payment account, or seeking reimbursement from the seller by any other lawful means, including by using third-party collections services. You authorize us to use any or all of the foregoing methods to seek reimbursement. Etsy may suspend your selling privileges at any time pending payment of your outstanding balance.

9. Payment Processing Fees
A. Overview. Etsy charges a fee (the “Payment Processing Fee”) for each transaction processed through Etsy Payments. The fee amount will be assessed on the gross order amount, including shipping and tax (if applicable). Payment Processing Fees will be reflected in your payment account and will be deducted from the total amount of the payment at the time the payment is considered complete. We reserve the right to modify the Payment Processing Fee at any time. For deposits below designated thresholds in certain markets, a deposit fee will apply, as described in the table below. Deposit fees are deducted from your Available Funds and reflected in your payment account at the time of your scheduled deposit. In the event of any partial or full refunds credited back to a buyer by a seller, the Payment Processing Fee and other applicable fees will be recalculated based on the adjusted sale price. The difference between the original Payment Processing Fee and the adjusted Payment Processing Fee will be applied to the refund amount being credited back to the seller. Other applicable fees will be refunded to the seller's payment account. Deposit fees will be refunded if the deposit is returned to a seller’s payment account. For clarity, for full refunds credited back to a buyer that are covered by Etsy (e.g., through Etsy’s Protection Program), the Payment Processing Fee and other applicable fees (including without limitation: transaction fee, offsite ads fee, etc.) will not be credited back to the seller.

B. Fee Amount. Payment Processing Fees vary based on the location of a seller’s bank account. Please see this chart for further details:

C. Listing Currency Conversion Considerations for Sellers. When a seller lists and subsequently sells an item in a currency other than the currency of the seller's payment account, Etsy will settle the associated transaction proceeds in the currency of the seller's payment account. When such a service is required, Etsy applies an additional 2.5% currency conversion fee. Calculation rates are updated regularly.

D. Value-Added Tax (VAT). Depending on your business status and location, Etsy may be required to charge VAT on seller fees accrued each month and remit it to the relevant tax authority. VAT is collected on Etsy Payments processing fees for sellers located in eligible Etsy Payments countries where required. To learn more about how VAT works on Etsy, see this Help article.

E. Browsing Currency Considerations for Buyers. In the case of a buyer purchasing from a seller who lists in a currency other than the buyer's browsing currency, Etsy will automatically calculate the listing price in the buyer's browsing currency. When such a calculation is required, Etsy applies an additional currency conversion charge. Calculation rates are updated regularly.

F. Interest. In the United States, Etsy may earn interest (or other compensation) from the balances in our bank accounts because of the timing difference between our being paid by buyers and our paying sellers (when our bank account is being debited to pay Available Funds in payment accounts to sellers).

10. Reporting Obligations
US

Internal Revenue Service regulations require that we file a Form 1099-K to report unadjusted annual gross sales information for sellers located in the United States or being paid in USD in certain circumstances. Please see this Help article for more details.

To comply with these regulations, sellers who meet or approach applicable thresholds in a calendar year, aggregated across his or her Shops, will be required to provide taxpayer-identification information to Etsy.

In addition to the IRS reporting requirements referenced above, certain states have enacted similar reporting regulations, and sellers who meet or approach applicable state thresholds will also be required to provide taxpayer-identification information to Etsy. Please see this Help article for details of reporting threshold requirements related to the specific states.

Non-US

Etsy is also required to report tax information to local tax authorities in certain countries outside the US. These reporting obligations are triggered when sellers make sales via Etsy and relevant thresholds for reporting are met.

To comply with these reporting obligations, Etsy requires that you add your taxpayer name, taxpayer-identification and/or other applicable information to your Etsy shop as you approach the relevant thresholds. Your selling privileges may be suspended until you provide this information.

11. Termination
Sellers may terminate this contract and their acceptance of Etsy Payments at any time by adjusting the Settings in their account with Etsy. Etsy may also terminate or suspend a seller’s use of Etsy Payments at any time.

Upon termination, any non-disputed Available Funds will be deposited into a seller’s bank account or a seller’s Payoneer Payment Account, as applicable. Etsy reserves the right, upon termination of access to Etsy Payments, to set off against any payments to be made to the seller, an amount determined by us to be adequate to cover any anticipated chargebacks, refunds, adjustments, or other amounts that might be paid to buyers in connection with purchases from the seller's payment account for a prospective 180-day period. At the end of the 180-day period following termination, we will disburse to the seller any amount not used to offset chargebacks, refunds, adjustments, or such other amounts paid to buyers, or seek reimbursement from the seller via any of the means authorized in this Policy for any additional amount required to offset chargebacks, refunds, adjustments, or other amounts paid to buyers, as applicable.
