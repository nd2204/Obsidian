Calories are a unit of measurement for energy, and they play an important role in the way your body functions. When you eat food, your body breaks down the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in that food into smaller molecules that can be used for energy.

If you consume more calories than your body needs for energy, your body will store the excess calories as fat. Over time, if you consistently consume more calories than you burn, you may gain weight and become overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese can increase your risk for a variety of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

On the other hand, if you consume fewer calories than your body needs for energy, your body will begin to use its stored fat for energy, which can result in weight loss. However, it's important to note that severely restricting calories can also be harmful to your health and can result in nutrient deficiencies and other health problems.

Overall, maintaining a healthy balance of calories is important for overall health and well-being. It's important to consume enough calories to provide your body with the energy it needs to function properly, but not so many that you gain excess weight. A balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods is key to achieving this balance.
