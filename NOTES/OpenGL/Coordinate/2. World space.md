If we would import all our ojects directly in the application they would probably all be somewhere positioned inside each other at the world origin of (0,0,0) which is not what we want. We want to define a position for each object to position them insdie a larger world. The coordinates in world space are exactly what they sound like: the coordinate space where you want your objects transformed to in such a way that they're all scattered around the place (preferably in a realistic fashion). The coordinates of your object are transformed from local to world space; this is accomplished with the *model* matrix

Think of it as transforming a house by scaling it down (it was a bit too large in local space), translating it to a suburbia town and rotating it a bit to the left on the y-axxis so that it neatly fits with the neighboring houses. You could think of matrix in the previous chapter to position the container all over the scene as a sort of model matrixx as well; we transformed the local coordinates of the container to some different place in the scene/world
