Local space is the coordinate space that is local to your oject, i.e where your object begins in, Imagine that you've created your cube in a modeling software package (like Blender). The origin of your cube is probably at (0,0,0) even though your cube may end up at a different location in your final application. Probably all the models you've created all have (0,0,0) as their initial position. All the vertices of your model are therefore in *local space*: they are all local to your object.
