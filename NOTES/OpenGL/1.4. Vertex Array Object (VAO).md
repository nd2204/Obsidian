> A *vertex array object* (also known as VAO) can be bound just like a *vertex buffer object* and any subsequent vertex attribute calls from that point on will be stored inside the VAO. This has the advantage that when configuring vertex attribute pointers you only have to make those calls once and whenever we want to draw the object, we can just bind the corresponding VAO. This makes switching between different vertex data and attribute configurations as easy as binding a different VAO. All the state we just set is stored inside the VAO.

A vertex array object stores the following:
• Calls to `glEnableVertexAttribArray` or `glDisableVertexAttribArray`.
• Vertex attribute configurations via `glVertexAttribPointer`.
• Vertex buffer objects associated with vertex attributes by calls to `glVertexAttribPointer`.

![[Excalidraw/VAO|VAO]]

The process to generate a VAO looks similar to that of a VBO:

```cpp
unsigned int VAO;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAO);
```

To use a VAO all you have to do is bind the VAO using `glBindVertexArray`. From that point on we should bind/configure the corresponding VBO(s) and attribute pointer(s) and then unbind the VAO for later use. As soon as we want to draw an object, we simply bind the VAO with the preferred settings before drawing the object and that is it. In code this would look a bit like this:

```cpp
//..::Initialization code (done once (unless your object frequently changes))::..

// 1. bind Vertex Array Object
glBindVertexArray(VAO);

// 2. copy our vertices array in a buffer for OpenGL to use
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

// 3. then set our vertex attributes pointers
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

[...]

// ..:: Drawing code (in render loop) :: ..
// 4. draw the object
glUseProgram(shaderProgram);
glBindVertexArray(VAO);
someOpenGLFunctionThatDrawsOurTriangle();
```

The moment we want to draw one of our objects, we take the corresponding VAO, bind it, then draw the object and unbind the VAO again.
