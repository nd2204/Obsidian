Texture coordinates usually range from (0, 0) to (1, 1) but what happens if we specify coordinates outside this range? The default behavior of OpenGL is to repeat the texture images (we basically ignore the integer part of the floating point texture coordinate), but there are more options OpenGL offers:
- `GL_REPEAT`: repeats the texture image (default)
- `GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT`: Same as `GL_REPEAT` but mirrors the image with each repeat.
- `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`: Clamps the coordinates between 0 and 1. The result is that higher coordinates become clamped to the edge, resulting in a stretched edge pattern.
- `GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER`: Coordinates outside the range are now given a user-specified border color.

Each of the options have a different visual output when using texture coordinates outside the default range. Let's see what these look like on a sample texture image

![[images/texture_wrapping.png]]

Each of the aforementioned options can be set per coordinate axis (s, t (and r if you're using 3D textures) equivalent to x, y, z) with the `glTexParameter*` function

```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT);
```

- The first argument specifies the texture target; we’re working with 2D textures so the texture target is `GL_TEXTURE_2D`.
- The second argument requires us to tell what option we want to set and for which texture axis; we want to configure it for both the `S` and `T` axis.
- The last argument requires us to pass in the texture wrapping mode we’d like and in this case OpenGL will set its texture wrapping option on the currently active texture with `GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT`.

> [!infomation] note
> If we choose the `GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER` option we should also specify a border color. This is done using the `fv` equivalent of the `glTexParameter` function with `GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR` as its option where we pass in a float array of the border’s color value:
> ```cpp
> float borderColor[] = { 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f };
> glTexParameterfv(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR, borderColor);
> ```
