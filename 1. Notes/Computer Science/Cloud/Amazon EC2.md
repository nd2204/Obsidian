## 📌 Key Points
---

#### **Client-Server Model**
- EC2 operates on the client-server model, where clients send requests to servers that process and respond to those requests.

#### **Virtual Servers**
- EC2 provides virtual servers[^1], allowing businesses to access compute capacity without the need for physical hardware. (see more: )

#### **Cost-Effectiveness**
- Using EC2 is more flexible and cost-effective compared to maintaining on-premises servers, as you only pay for the instances you use.

#### **Multitenancy**
- EC2 instances share physical resources through virtualization, managed by a hypervisor, ensuring security and isolation between instances.

 #### **Configuration Control**
 - Users can choose the operating system, software, and network settings for their EC2 instances, allowing for customization based on business needs.
#### **Scalability**
- EC2 instances can be resized easily, enabling vertical scaling to meet changing demands.
