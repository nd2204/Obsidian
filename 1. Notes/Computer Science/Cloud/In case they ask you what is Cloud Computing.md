- **On-Demand Delivery**: Resources are available when needed without prior notification. For example, you can quickly launch virtual servers or storage as required.
- **IT Resources**: AWS offers a wide range of products to meet common business needs, allowing companies to focus on their unique data and processes rather than repetitive IT tasks.
- **Access Over the Internet**: Resources can be accessed securely online without the need for contracts or sales calls.
- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**: This model allows businesses to only pay for resources they use, similar to staffing a shop only during peak hours.
