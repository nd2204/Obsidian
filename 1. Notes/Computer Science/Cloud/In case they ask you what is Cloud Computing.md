> [!INFORMATION] Overview
> Cloud Computing is the *on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet* with a *pay-as-you-go pricing model*.

---
## üìå Key Points
---

- **On-Demand Delivery**: Resources are available when needed without prior notification. For example, you can quickly launch virtual servers or storage as required.
- **IT Resources**: AWS offers a wide range of products to meet common business needs, allowing companies to focus on their unique data and processes rather than repetitive IT tasks.
- **Access Over the Internet**: Resources can be accessed securely online without the need for contracts or sales calls.
- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**: This model allows businesses to only pay for resources they use, similar to staffing a shop only during peak hours.

## üìà Benefit

Consider why a company might choose to take a particular cloud computing approach when addressing business needs.

#### **Trade upfront expense for variable expense**
Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you‚Äôre going to use them.

By taking a cloud computing approach that offers the benefit of variable expense, companies can implement innovative solutions while saving on costs.

#### **Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers**
Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers.¬†A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.

#### **Stop guessing capacity**
With cloud computing, you don‚Äôt have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.¬†For example, you can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time you use. Instead of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity, you can access only the capacity that you need. You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand.

#### **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers, such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale. The economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.¬†[^1]

### **Increase speed and agility**
The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.

This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and innovate. When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparison, cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.

### **Go global in minutes**
The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency. This means that even if you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays.¬†

- [[Cloud Computing Deployment Model]]


[^1]: When you use cloud computing (like Amazon Web Services or AWS), you can save money compared to running your own servers. That‚Äôs because cloud providers serve _many_ customers ‚Äî often hundreds of thousands ‚Äî at the same time.
	
	Because they have so many customers, they can buy hardware, internet bandwidth, and power in massive quantities, which lowers their cost per unit. This is called **economies of scale** ‚Äî basically, the more you buy or produce, the cheaper it gets per item.
	
	Cloud providers then pass some of those savings on to you. So instead of paying a lot to buy and maintain your own servers, you just pay for what you use in the cloud, often at a much lower cost. That‚Äôs what they mean by **lower variable cost** and **pay-as-you-go prices**.
