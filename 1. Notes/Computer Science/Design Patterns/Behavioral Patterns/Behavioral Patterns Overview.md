## 📚 Patterns
---


|**Pattern**|**Usefulness (1–5)**|**Difficulty (1–5)**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Observer**|5.0|2.0|Core for event-driven design, UI systems, and pub-sub mechanisms.|
|**Strategy**|4.5|2.0|A go-to for making algorithms interchangeable; very intuitive.|
|**Command**|4.0|3.0|Powerful for decoupling senders/receivers, task queues, or undo stacks.|
|**Iterator**|4.0|1.5|Very easy in most languages; great for abstracting collections.|
|**State**|4.0|3.0|Clean handling of object state transitions; can be overused.|
|**Chain of Responsibility**|3.5|3.0|Ideal for flexible request handling pipelines. Slightly abstract.|
|**Mediator**|3.5|3.5|Reduces coupling between classes, but may grow too central.|
|**Template Method**|3.0|2.0|Solid for frameworks and base class extension; can feel rigid.|
|**Visitor**|3.0|4.0|Good for structured object operations (like ASTs); breaks encapsulation.|
|**Memento**|2.5|3.0|Handy for snapshotting internal state (e.g., undo), but not broadly needed.|
|**Null Object**|2.5|1.0|Lightweight and simple; avoids null checks, rarely critical though.|
|**Interpreter**|2.0|5.0|Niche usage (custom DSLs, language parsers); high complexity.|
