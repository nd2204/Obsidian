To calculate your daily nutrient needs for muscle growth, we can use the following steps:

- Step 1: Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Harris-Benedict equation:

	- BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677 x age in years)
%%
(IN MY CASE)
BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x 61) + (4.799 x 178) - (5.677 x 18) = 1625.5 calories per day
%%
- Step 2: Multiply your BMR by an activity factor to get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):
	- Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR x 1.2
	- Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR x 1.375
	- Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR x 1.55
	- Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week): BMR x 1.725
	- Super active (very hard exercise/sports, physical job or training twice a day): BMR x 1.9
		- TDEE = BMR * Activity_Factor_Constant
%%
Since my activity level is very low, i will use the sedentary activity factor:
TDEE = 1625.5 x 1.2 = 1950.6 calories per day
%%
- Step 3: Determine your protein needs based on your body weight and activity level:

	- Sedentary: 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight
	- Lightly active: 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight
	- Moderately active: 1.4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight
	- Very active: 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight
	- Super active: 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight
		- Protein_needs = body_weight * Activity_Level_Constant
%%
Since you are planning to get in shape and build muscle, we will use the moderately active protein recommendation of 1.4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
Protein needs = 1.4 grams/kg x 61 kg = 85.4 grams of protein per day
%%

- Step 4: Determine your carbohydrate and fat needs:

	- Carbohydrates: 45-65% of daily calorie intake
		 - For workout : carbohydrate >= 55%
		 - Carbohydrates = BMR * 0.60
	- Fat: 20-35% of daily calorie intake
		 - For workout : fat <= 25%
		 - Fat = BMR * 20

%%
To ensure that you have enough energy for your workouts, we will use the higher end of the carbohydrate range and the lower end of the fat range:

Carbohydrate needs = 60% x 1950.6 calories = 1170.4 calories / 4 calories per gram = 292.6 grams of carbohydrates per day
Fat needs = 20% x 1950.6 calories = 390.1 calories / 9 calories per gram = 43.3 grams of fat per day

So, for muscle growth, you should aim to consume approximately 1950.6 calories per day, with 85.4 grams of protein, 292.6 grams of carbohydrates, and 43.3 grams of fat. Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and your individual needs may vary based on your body composition, training regimen, and other factors. It may be helpful to consult with a registered dietitian or certified sports nutritionist to develop a personalized plan that is tailored to your specific needs and goals.

> The nutrient requirements and calorie calculations provided by online calculators and formulas can be useful as a starting point, but they may not be entirely accurate for everyone. These calculators and formulas are based on general assumptions about average body composition, metabolism, and physical activity levels, and do not take into account individual variations in body composition, genetics, and other factors that can affect nutrient needs and calorie requirements. Therefore, it is important to use these calculations as a rough estimate and adjust your diet and exercise plan based on your individual needs and goals, and under the guidance of a healthcare professional or a certified nutritionist or fitness trainer.
