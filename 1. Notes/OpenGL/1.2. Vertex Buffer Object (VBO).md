> [!information] Overview
A Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) is a fundamental concept in OpenGL, serving as a mechanism for efficiently managing and transferring vertex data from the CPU to the GPU. VBOs play a crucial role in optimizing rendering performance by minimizing redundant data transfers and providing a means for storing vertex attributes.

**Key Characteristics and Usage:**

1. **Storage of Vertex Data:**
    - VBOs store vertex-related data, such as positions, colors, normals, and texture coordinates.
    - Efficiently manages large datasets, reducing the overhead of repeated data transfers.
	
2. **Buffer Creation:**
    - Buffers are created using the `glGenBuffers()` function: 
		```cpp
		// create 1 buffer
		unsigned int VBO;
		glGenBuffers(11, &VBO);
		
		// create multiple buffers
		unsinged int VBOs[3];
		glGenBuffers(3, VBOs);
		```
    - VBOs are typically associated with the `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` target.
	
3. **Binding and Unbinding:**
    - Buffers must be bound to a specific target using `glBindBuffer()` before performing operations on them:
		```cpp
		// Bind VBO (previous example) to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target (which is our VBO buffer type)
		glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
		```
    - Unbinding is achieved by binding a buffer with a target set to zero (`glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0)`).
	
4. **Loading Data:**
    - Vertex data is loaded into the VBO using `glBufferData()` e.g:
		```cpp
		// initialize our vertex data
		float vertices[] = {
			-0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f,
			 0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f,
			 0.0f,  0.5f, 0.0f
		};
		
		// Load our vertex data (vertices) on to the current bound GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target (which is VBO from the previous example)
		glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW)
		
		/*
		glBufferData is a function specifically targeted to copy user-defined data into the currently bound buffer.
		- Its first argument is the type of the buffer we want to copy data into: the vertex buffer object currently bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target.
		- The second argument specifies the size of the data (in bytes) we want to pass to the buffer; a simple sizeof of the vertex data suffices.
		- The third parameter is the actual data we want to send.
		- The fourth parameter specifies how we want the graphics card to manage the given data. This can take 3 forms:
			• GL_STREAM_DRAW: the data is set only once and used by the GPU at most a few times.
			• GL_STATIC_DRAW: the data is set only once and used many times.
			• GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW: the data is changed a lot and used many times.
		*/
		```
    - The data can be static, dynamic, or streamed based on the application's needs.
	
5. **Updating Data:**
    - Data in a VBO can be updated using `glBufferSubData()` or by mapping the buffer into client space with `glMapBuffer()`.
	
6. **Vertex Attributes: [[1.4. Vertex Array Object (VAO)]]**
    - VBOs are used in conjunction with Vertex Array Objects (VAOs) to define vertex attributes.
    - The association between VBOs and vertex attributes is established through attribute pointers.
	
7. **Rendering Efficiency:**
    - Enhances rendering performance by allowing reuse of vertex data without redundant transfers.
	

**Best Practices:**

- When dealing with large datasets, using VBOs is preferred to reduce CPU-GPU data transfer overhead.
- Employ appropriate usage hints (`GL_STATIC_DRAW`, `GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW`, etc.) based on how often the data is expected to change.
