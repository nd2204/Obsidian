###### Challenges of Uniform Texture Usage**

Imagine we had a vast room filled with numerous objects, each equipped with textures, a challenge arises when objects at a distance share the same high-resolution texture as those near the viewer. OpenGL encounters difficulty fetching precise color values for fragments, leading to visible artifacts on smaller objects. Additionally, using high-resolution textures on distant, minimally contributing objects consumes unnecessary memory bandwidth.

###### Mipmaps: Optimizing Distant Object Rendering

To address this, OpenGL employs mipmaps — a collection of texture images, each half the size of the preceding one. Beyond a certain distance threshold, OpenGL switches to an appropriate mipmap texture. Since the object is distant, the reduced resolution is imperceptible to the user. This ensures accurate texel sampling, minimizes cache memory usage, and mitigates artifacts on smaller objects:

Creating a collection of mipmapped textures for each texture image is cumbersome to do manually, but luckily OpenGL is able to do all the work for us with a single call to `glGenerateMipmap` after we've created a texture.

When switching between mipmaps levels during rendering OpenGL may show some artifacts like sharp edges visible between the two mipmap layers. Just like normal texture filtering, it is also possible to filter between mipmap levels using `NEAREST` and `LINEAR` filtering for switching between mipmap levels. To specify the filtering method between mipmap levels we can replace the original filtering methods with one of the following four options:

- `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST`: takes the nearest mipmap to match the pixel size and uses nearest neighbor interpolation for texture sampling.
- `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST`: takes the nearest mipmap level and samples that level using linear interpolation.
- `GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR`: linearly interpolates between the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of a pixel and samples the interpolated level via nearest neighbor interpolation.
- `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR`: linearly interpolates between the two closest mipmaps and samples the interpolated level via linear interpolation.

Just like texture filtering we can set the filtering method to one of the 4 aforementioned methods using `glTexParameteri`:

```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
```

A common mistake is to set one of the mipmap filtering options as the magnification filter. This doesn't have any effect since mipmaps are primarily used for when textures get downscaled: texture magnification doesn't use mipmaps and giving it a mipmap filtering option will generate an OpenGL `GL_INVALID_ENUM` error code.
