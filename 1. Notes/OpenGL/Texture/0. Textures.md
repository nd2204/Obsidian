think of a texture as a piece of paper with a nice brick image (for example) on it neatly folded over your 3D house so it looks like your house has a stone exterior. Because we can insert a lot of detail in a single image, we can give the illusion the object is extremely detailed without having to speccify extra vertices

Below you'll see a texture image of a brick wall mapped to the triangle from the previous chapter: ![[textures.png]]

- In order to map a texture to the triangle we need to tell each vertex of the triangle which part of the texture it corresponds to. Each vertex should thus have a texture coordinate associated with them that specifies what part of the texture image to sample from. Fragment interpolation then does the rest for the other fragments.

- Texture coordinates range from 0 to 1 in the x and y axis (remember that we use 2D texture images). Retrieving the texture color using texture coordinate is called *sampling*. Texture coordinates start at (0, 0) for the lower left corner of a texture image to (1, 1) for the upper right corner of a texture image. The following image shows how we map texture coordinates to the triangle: ![[texture_coordinates.png]]

We specify 3 texture coordinate points for the triangle.
- We want the bottom left side of the triangle to correspond with the bottom-left side of the texture so we use the (0, 0) texture coordinate for the triangle's bottom-left vertex
- The same applies to the bottom right side with a (1, 0) texture coordinate.
- The top of the triangle should correspond with the top-center of the texture image so we take (0.5, 1.0) as its texture coordinate
We only have to pass 3 texture coordinates to the vertex shader, which then passes those to the fragment shader that neatly interpolates all the texture coordinates for each fragment.

The resulting texture coordinates would then look like this:
```cpp
float texCoords[] = {
    0.0f,  0.0f,  // lower-left corner
    1.0f,  0.0f,  // lower-right corner
    0.5f,  1.0f,  // top-center corner
};
```
Texture sampling has a loos interpretation and can be done in many different ways It is thus our job to tell OpenGL how it should *sample* its textures.
