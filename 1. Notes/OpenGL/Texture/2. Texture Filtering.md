Texture coordinates do not depend on resolution but can be any floating point value, thus OpenGL has to figure out which texture pixel (also known as a *texel* ) to map the texture coordinate to. This becomes especially important if you have a very large object and a low resolution texture. You probably guessed by now that OpenGL has options for this texture filtering as well. There are several options available but for now we'll discuss the most important options: `GL_NEAREST` and `GL_LINEAR`.

- `GL_NEAREST` (also known as nearest neighbor or point filtering) is the default texture filtering method of OpenGL. When set to `GL_NEAREST`, OpenGL selects the *texel* that center is closest to the texture coordinate. Below you can see 4 pixels where the cross represents the exact texture coordinate. The upper-left *texel* has its center closest to the texture coordinate and is therefore chosen as the sampled color: ![[filter_nearest.png]]

- `GL_LINEAR` (also known as (bi)linear filtering) takes an interpolated value from the texture coordinate's neighboring texels, approximating a color between the texels. The smaller the distance from the texture coordinate to a texel's center, the more that texel's color contributes to the sampled color. Below we can see that a mixed color of the neighboring pixels is returned: ![[filter_bilinear.png]]
But what is the visual effect of such a texture filtering method? Let's see how these methods work when using a texture with a low resolution on a large object (texture is therefore scaled upwards and individual texels are noticeable): ![[texture_filtering.png]]

`GL_NEAREST` results in blocked patterns where we can clearly see the pixels that form the texture while `GL_LINEAR` produces a smoother pattern where the individual pixels are less visible. `GL_LINEAR` produces a more realistic output, but some developers prefer a more 8-bit look and as a result pick the `GL_NEAREST` option.

Texture filtering can be set for *magnifying* and *minifying* operations (when scaling up or downwards) so you could for example use nearest neighbor filtering when textures are scaled downwards and linear filtering for upscaled textures. We thus have to specify the filtering method for both options via `glTexParameter*`. The code should look similar to setting the wrapping method:

```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
```
